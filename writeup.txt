We tested our solver against Forge's solver using the ring problem from the
Forge2 homework assignment. When running to find world which satisfied isRing for
exactly 4 nodes, Forge found an instance in 5 milliseconds whereas our solver 
took 7293 milliseconds. When attempting an UNSAT case where we modified the
isRing predicate to be impossible, Forge determined UNSAT in 0 milliseconds while
our solver took noticeably longer, printing #f for each of the stats. We believe
some of this difference is do to our solver having potentially excessive iterations
and not compiling using optimizations.

Our tests can be found in test.hs, and the file may be run from root with `runhaskell test.hs`.
